# Site-to-Site VPN

## What is a Site-to-Site VPN?

A **site-to-site Virtual Private Network (VPN)** is a connection between two or more networks, often connecting geographically distant offices of a business. It creates a secure and encrypted communication tunnel over the internet, allowing data to be transmitted securely between the connected sites. This type of VPN is commonly used to facilitate secure communication between branch offices or between a branch office and a central headquarters.

## TCP/IP

**TCP/IP**, or Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol, is a suite of communication protocols that form the foundation of the internet. It provides the rules for how data is sent, received, and routed between devices on a network. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data, while IP (Internet Protocol) handles the addressing and routing of data packets. TCP/IP is fundamental to internet communication and is used for a wide range of applications, including web browsing, email, and file transfer.

## Popular Reasons for Using a VPN

- **Security and Privacy:** VPNs encrypt internet traffic, making it difficult for third parties to intercept or access data.
- **Remote Access:** VPNs enable secure access to a private network over the internet, which is useful for remote workers connecting to their company's network.
- **Bypassing Geo-restrictions:** Users can access content restricted to specific regions by connecting to a VPN server in that region.
- **Anonymous Browsing:** VPNs hide users' IP addresses, enhancing anonymity while browsing the internet.
